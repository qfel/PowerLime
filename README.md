PowerLime
=========

A collection of various Sublime Text 2 enchantments I've written for myself.
It might be worth integrating some of the code into other plugins.

Available commands
==================

To get an idea of how new things work, look at Default.sublime-commands.
It's especially easy with new "Run Application/Window/Text command" commands.

Installation
============
Use "Package Control: Add Repository" command and type
https://github.com/piotr-kufel/PowerLime
Then you can install the package with "Package Control: Install Package"
